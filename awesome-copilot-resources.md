# Awesome Copilot Resources

I have explored the [awesome-copilot](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot) repository and found the following resources that might be relevant to your project:

## Python & Backend (FastAPI)

### Agents
- **Python MCP Server Expert** (`agents/python-mcp-expert.agent.md`): An expert agent for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in Python. It covers best practices, type safety, and transport configuration.

### Prompts
- **Python MCP Server Generator** (`prompts/python-mcp-server-generator.prompt.md`): A prompt to generate a complete, production-ready MCP server in Python.

### Instructions
- **Python Coding Conventions** (`instructions/python.instructions.md`): General guidelines for Python code, including docstrings, type hints, and error handling.

## Frontend (React Native)

### Skills
- **Web Application Testing** (`skills/webapp-testing/SKILL.md`): A skill for testing web applications using Playwright.
    - *Note*: The skill explicitly mentions that for native mobile apps, you should use **React Native Testing Library** instead of Playwright.

## How to use
You can use these resources to:
1.  **Generate an MCP Server**: Use the prompt to create a new MCP server for your backend.
2.  **Improve Code Quality**: Apply the Python instructions to your existing FastAPI code.
3.  **Setup Testing**: Use the insights from the testing skill to set up a robust testing strategy for your React Native app (adapting for React Native Testing Library).
