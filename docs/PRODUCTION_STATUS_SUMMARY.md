## ⚠️ Remaining Steps for Production (CRITICAL)

### 1. Security Configuration (2-3 days)
- [ ] **Generate new JWT secrets** (64+ characters, not defaults)
  ```bash
  python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(64))"
  ```
- [ ] **Obtain SSL/TLS certificates** (Let's Encrypt free or commercial)
  ```bash
  sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
  ```
- [ ] **Configure CORS whitelist** (update backend/.env.production)
  ```
  CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://app.yourdomain.com
  ```
- [ ] **Enable MongoDB authentication**
  ```bash
  mongosh admin --eval 'db.createUser({user: "admin", pwd: "...", roles: ["root"]})'
  ```
- [ ] **Configure firewall rules** (ufw/iptables)

### 2. Infrastructure Setup (3-5 days)
- [ ] **Provision production servers**
  - Backend: 4 cores, 8GB RAM, 50GB SSD
  - MongoDB: 4 cores, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD
  - Redis: 2 cores, 4GB RAM (optional but recommended)
- [ ] **Configure MongoDB replica set** (high availability)
- [ ] **Setup load balancer** (nginx reverse proxy)
- [ ] **Configure DNS records** (A records for domain)

### 3. Monitoring & Backup (2-3 days)
- [ ] **Configure automated backups** (already coded, needs activation)
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d backup
  ```
- [ ] **Setup monitoring** (Sentry for errors, UptimeRobot for uptime)
- [ ] **Configure alerts** (email, SMS, Slack for critical issues)
- [ ] **Test backup restoration** (validate disaster recovery)

### 4. Final Verification (1 day)
- [ ] **Run load tests** (verify performance under load)
- [ ] **Security scan** (Trivy already in CI, run manual penetration test)
- [ ] **Smoke tests** (test all critical flows)
- [ ] **Documentation review** (ensure ops team has runbooks)

**Total Time to Production: 8-12 days** (depending on infrastructure provisioning)
