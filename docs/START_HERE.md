- ✅ Direct user impact
- ✅ Multiple sub-features
- ✅ Performance optimization

**What you'll learn:**
- Camera APIs
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX best practices
- State management

**AI Prompt to Start:**
```
I want to enhance the barcode scanner in frontend/app/scan.tsx with:
1. Multi-barcode scanning (scan multiple items at once)
2. Visual feedback for successful scans
3. Better error handling
4. Scan history

Show me the current implementation and suggest improvements following React Native best practices.
```

---

### 🏅 #4: Advanced Search & Filtering (2 weeks)
**Why this helps:**
- ✅ Productivity improvement
- ✅ Database optimization learning
- ✅ Full-stack feature
- ✅ Clear success criteria

**What you'll learn:**
- MongoDB text search
- Indexing strategies
- React state management
- Performance optimization

**AI Prompt to Start:**
```
I want to enhance item search with:
1. Fuzzy search (typo-tolerant) using MongoDB text search
2. Filters (category, location, variance status)
3. Recent items quick access
4. Search history

Show me the current search in backend/api/enhanced_item_api.py and frontend/app/items.tsx. Suggest MongoDB indexing strategy and implementation plan.
```

## 🎨 The Vibe Coding Mindset

### Key Principles

1. **Start Small**
   - Don't try to build everything at once
   - Small commits > big rewrites

2. **Ask Questions**
   - Your AI assistant is here to help
   - No question is too basic
   - Be specific in your prompts

3. **Follow Patterns**
   - This codebase has established patterns
   - Consistency > cleverness
   - When in doubt, ask AI to "follow the pattern in [file]"

4. **Test Everything**
   - Tests are your safety net
   - Write tests as you code
   - Run tests before committing

5. **Iterate**
   - First version doesn't need to be perfect
   - Get feedback early
   - Improve incrementally

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Don't add new frameworks without asking
- Don't skip testing
- Don't commit without running `make ci`
- Don't change architecture without understanding it
- Don't ignore security best practices

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Follow existing patterns
- Write tests for every feature
- Run full test suite before committing
- Ask AI to explain before changing
- Always validate and sanitize inputs
