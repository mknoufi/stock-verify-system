  "summary": "Updated all TestSprite test scripts to include login steps. Created test_helpers.py with login_user() function that handles authentication using default test credentials (staff1/staff123, supervisor/super123, admin/admin123). Updated all 5 test files to: (1) Import and use login helper, (2) Increase timeouts from 5s to 30s for context and 10s to 60s for navigation, (3) Wait for networkidle instead of just commit, (4) Add proper login flow before test actions. Tests should now authenticate before attempting other operations, resolving timeout issues.",
  "current_status": "All test scripts updated with login functionality. Created reusable login helper. Increased timeouts. Tests now authenticate before performing actions. Ready for re-running tests to verify fixes work."
