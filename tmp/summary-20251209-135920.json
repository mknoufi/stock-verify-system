  "summary": "Analyzed TestSprite timeout issues based on official documentation. Identified root causes: (1) Tests don't perform authentication - they navigate but never login, (2) Timeouts too short (5s context timeout vs 10s+ app initialization), (3) Missing test credentials. Created comprehensive analysis document with solutions. Backend and frontend are running correctly. Need to add login steps to tests, increase timeouts, and create test user accounts.",
  "current_status": "Root causes identified: Missing authentication in tests, insufficient timeouts, missing test credentials. Analysis document created (TIMEOUT_ANALYSIS.md) with detailed solutions. Backend (8001) and frontend (19006) verified working. Next steps: Add login steps to tests, increase timeouts, create test users."
