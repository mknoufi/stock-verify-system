  "summary": "Updated all TestSprite test files to use port 19006 (Expo web server) instead of port 8081 (Metro bundler). Fixed 11 occurrences across 4 test files (test_001 already had correct port). All tests now point to the correct web interface. Verified no instances of port 8081 remain in test files.",
  "current_status": "All test files updated successfully. Root cause of test failures (wrong port) has been fixed. Tests are now configured to access Expo web server on port 19006. Ready for re-running tests to verify fixes."
