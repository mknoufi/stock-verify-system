  "summary": "Identified root cause of TestSprite test failures. All 5 tests failed because they are accessing port 8081 (Metro bundler) instead of port 19006 (Expo web server). Tests report empty pages because Metro is for native apps, not web testing. TestSprite requires the web server on port 19006. Solution: Update all test files to use port 19006 instead of 8081.",
  "current_status": "Root cause identified: Wrong port configuration. All tests failed due to accessing Metro (8081) instead of Web server (19006). Test files need to be updated to use correct port. Frontend web server is running correctly on port 19006."
