## ✅ Pre-flight Checklist (15 minutes)

### 1. Clone & Navigate
```bash
# You should already have this
cd /path/to/STOCK_VERIFY_ui

# Verify you're in the right place
ls -la  # Should see backend/, frontend/, docs/, etc.
```

### 2. Check Python & Node
```bash
# Python 3.10+ required
python3 --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher

# Node 18+ required
node --version     # Should be 18 or higher
npm --version      # Should be 9 or higher
```

### 3. Install Core Dependencies
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install ruff black mypy pytest

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Return to root
cd ..
```

### 4. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create backend .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Generate secrets
cd backend
python scripts/generate_secrets.py

# Edit backend/.env with a text editor
# Paste the generated JWT secrets
# Configure your SQL Server details (or use defaults for now)
```

### 5. Verify Installation
```bash
# Test backend
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Expected: Tests should run (some may fail without DB, that's OK for now)

# Test frontend
cd ../frontend
npm run typecheck
# Expected: Should complete without errors
```

✅ **If you got this far, you're ready to code!**

## 🚀 Your First Vibe Coding Task (1 hour)

### Task: Add Better Error Messages

**What you'll do:** Improve user-facing error messages in the mobile app

**Why this is perfect for learning:**
- ✅ Small scope (won't break things)
- ✅ Touches multiple files (learn structure)
- ✅ Immediate visual impact
- ✅ No complex logic
- ✅ Easy to test

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Start Your AI Assistant

Choose one:
- **Cursor:** Open project in Cursor IDE
- **GitHub Copilot Chat:** Open in VS Code
- **Aider:** Run `aider` in terminal
- **Cline:** Open VS Code with Cline extension

#### 2. First AI Prompt

Copy and paste this exact prompt:

```
I'm working on the Stock Verify mobile app (React Native + Expo). I want to improve error messages shown to users when API calls fail. Currently, users see technical error messages. I want to replace them with friendly, actionable messages.

First, show me:
1. Where API calls are made (likely in frontend/services/api.ts)
2. Current error handling implementation
3. Examples of error messages users currently see

Then suggest a plan to improve them following the existing code patterns.
```

#### 3. Review the Response

Your AI will show you the current code. Look for:
- `frontend/services/api.ts` - API client
- Error handling in `catch` blocks
- Any existing error message constants

#### 4. Next Prompt (After Reviewing)

```
Create a new file frontend/constants/errorMessages.ts that maps error codes to user-friendly messages. Include messages for:
- Network errors (no connection)
- Authentication errors (401, 403)
- Not found errors (404)
- Server errors (500)
- Timeout errors

Follow TypeScript best practices and the existing code style in this project.
```

#### 5. Implement the File

Your AI will generate the code. Review it and create the file:

```bash
# The AI will show you the code, then you create it:
cd frontend
# Create constants/errorMessages.ts with the generated code
```

#### 6. Update API Service

Next prompt:
```
Now update frontend/services/api.ts to use the new error messages. Replace technical errors with user-friendly messages from errorMessages.ts. Show me the changes needed.
```

#### 7. Test Your Changes

```bash
cd frontend

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# If there are errors, ask AI:
"Fix these TypeScript errors: [paste errors]"
```

#### 8. Manual Testing

```bash
# Start the backend (in one terminal)
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn backend.server:app --reload --port 8001

# Start the frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm start

# Test scenarios:
# 1. Turn off backend → should show "connection error" message
# 2. Invalid login → should show "invalid credentials" message
# 3. etc.
```

#### 9. Commit Your Work

```bash
git add frontend/constants/errorMessages.ts
git add frontend/services/api.ts
git commit -m "feat: add user-friendly error messages"

# Or ask AI to generate commit message:
"Generate a conventional commit message for these changes"
```

✅ **Congratulations! You just made your first vibe coding contribution!**

## 🎯 Next Tasks (Choose Your Own Adventure)

### Path A: UI/UX Improvements (Beginner-Friendly)

**Task 1: Loading States** (2 hours)
```
Add loading spinners to all screens in the mobile app. Use the existing design system from frontend/theme/modernDesignSystem.ts. Show me screens that need loading states and suggest implementation.
```

**Task 2: Empty States** (2 hours)
```
Add empty state messages when lists are empty (no items, no sessions, etc.). Make them helpful and actionable. Show me components that need empty states.
```

**Task 3: Success Feedback** (2 hours)
```
Add success toast notifications when users complete actions (item scanned, session created, etc.). Use a toast library compatible with React Native. Show implementation examples.
```

### Path B: Feature Enhancements (Intermediate)

**Task 1: Search History** (4 hours)
```
Implement search history for the item search. Store recent searches in AsyncStorage, display them as quick access chips. Show me the search component and suggest implementation.
```

**Task 2: Barcode History** (4 hours)
```
Add a "recently scanned" section showing the last 10 barcodes scanned. Allow quick re-scan from history. Integrate with the scan screen.
```

**Task 3: Session Filters** (4 hours)
```
Add filter options to the sessions list (filter by status, date range, warehouse). Implement using React state and query parameters.
```

### Path C: Backend Improvements (Intermediate-Advanced)

**Task 1: API Documentation** (3 hours)
```
Improve API documentation in the OpenAPI schema. Add examples, better descriptions, and response schemas. Review backend/api/*.py files and enhance docstrings.
```

**Task 2: Input Validation** (4 hours)
```
Add comprehensive input validation using Pydantic models. Review all API endpoints and ensure all inputs are validated. Show me endpoints missing validation.
```

**Task 3: Error Logging** (3 hours)
```
Improve error logging with structured logging. Add context (user_id, session_id) to all error logs. Review backend/server.py logging setup.
```

pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Ask AI for help:
"These tests are failing: [paste error]. Help me fix them."
```

### Problem: TypeScript Errors

**Solution:**
```bash
cd frontend

# Check what's wrong
npm run typecheck
