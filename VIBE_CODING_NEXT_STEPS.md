### Step 2: Choose Your First Task (Pick ONE)

Based on the Feature Roadmap, here are the **highest impact, easiest to start** tasks:

#### 🥇 OPTION A: Enhanced Barcode Scanner (2-3 weeks)
**Why:** Core feature, high user impact, clear scope
**What:** Improve scanning speed, add multi-barcode support, better error handling

**Files to Study:**
- `frontend/app/scan.tsx` - Main scan screen
- `frontend/services/api.ts` - API calls
- `backend/api/enhanced_item_api.py` - Item lookup endpoint

**Vibe Coding Starting Prompt:**
```
I want to enhance the barcode scanner with the following features:
1. Multi-barcode scanning (scan multiple items at once)
2. Better error handling when barcode not found
3. Visual feedback for successful scans
4. History of recently scanned items

Show me the current implementation in scan.tsx and suggest improvements following the existing code patterns.
```

---

#### 🥈 OPTION B: Push Notifications (1-2 weeks)
**Why:** High engagement impact, standard Expo feature
**What:** Add push notifications for session assignments and variance alerts

**Files to Study:**
- `frontend/app.json` - Expo configuration
- `backend/api/sessions_api.py` - Session management
- `backend/services/notification_service.py` (create this)

**Vibe Coding Starting Prompt:**
```
I want to implement push notifications using Expo's notification system. Users should receive notifications when:
1. They are assigned to a new counting session
2. A variance threshold is exceeded
3. A session is completed

Set up the Expo notifications configuration and create the backend notification service following FastAPI patterns.
```

---

#### 🥉 OPTION C: Advanced Search & Filtering (2 weeks)
**Why:** Improves productivity, builds on existing search
**What:** Add fuzzy search, filters, recent items, search history

**Files to Study:**
- `frontend/app/items.tsx` - Items list screen
- `backend/api/enhanced_item_api.py` - Item search endpoint
- `frontend/services/api.ts` - API integration

**Vibe Coding Starting Prompt:**
```
I want to enhance the item search with:
1. Fuzzy search (typo-tolerant using MongoDB text search)
2. Filter by category, location, variance status
3. Recent items quick access
4. Search history

Start by showing me the current search implementation and suggest MongoDB indexing strategy.
```

---

#### 🏅 OPTION D: Biometric Authentication (1 week)
**Why:** Quick win, great UX improvement, Expo built-in
**What:** Add Face ID / Touch ID support for mobile login

**Files to Study:**
- `frontend/app/login.tsx` - Login screen
- `frontend/services/auth.ts` - Authentication service
- `backend/api/auth_api.py` - Auth endpoints

**Vibe Coding Starting Prompt:**
```
I want to add biometric authentication (Face ID / Touch ID) to the mobile app using expo-local-authentication. Users should be able to:
1. Enable biometric login in settings
2. Use fingerprint/face to log in instead of password
3. Fall back to password if biometric fails
4. Store token securely using expo-secure-store

Show me how to implement this following React Native best practices.
```

---

### Step 3: Execute Your Chosen Task

#### The Vibe Coding Workflow

1. **Understand** (30 mins - 1 hour)
   ```
   # Ask your AI assistant:
   "Show me all files related to [feature]. Explain the current architecture."
   "What design patterns are used in this codebase?"
   "Are there any existing tests I should be aware of?"
   ```

2. **Plan** (15-30 mins)
   ```
   "Create a detailed implementation plan for [feature] with:
   - Files to create/modify
   - Database schema changes (if any)
   - API endpoints needed
   - Frontend components needed
   - Test cases to write"
   ```

3. **Implement** (iterative)
   ```
   "Implement [specific component] following the existing patterns in [file]"
   "Add error handling similar to how it's done in [example]"
   "Create tests for [function] matching the style in [test file]"
   ```

4. **Test** (continuous)
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   pytest tests/test_[your_feature].py -v

   # Frontend type checking
   cd frontend
   npm run typecheck

   # Linting
   make lint
   ```

5. **Review** (before committing)
   ```
   "Review my changes for:
   - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Type safety issues
   - Performance concerns
   - Missing error handling
   - Test coverage gaps"
   ```

6. **Commit** (follow conventions)
   ```bash
   # Conventional commits format
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add biometric authentication support"

   # Or use AI:
   "Generate a conventional commit message for these changes"
   ```

---

### Step 4: Quick Wins (While Learning)

Before diving into major features, try these **small improvements** to get familiar:

#### Quick Win 1: Add Loading Indicators (2 hours)
**Prompt:**
```
Add loading spinners to all API calls in the mobile app. Use the existing design system from modernDesignSystem.ts. Show me the current implementation and suggest improvements.
```

#### Quick Win 2: Improve Error Messages (3 hours)
**Prompt:**
```
Review all error messages in the frontend and make them more user-friendly. Replace technical errors with helpful messages. Follow the patterns in error_messages.py for the backend.
```

#### Quick Win 3: Add Input Validation (4 hours)
**Prompt:**
```
Add client-side validation for all forms in the mobile app. Use React Hook Form or similar. Validate barcodes, quantities, and user inputs before sending to API.
```

#### Quick Win 4: Optimize Database Queries (3 hours)
**Prompt:**
```
Analyze the most common database queries in enhanced_item_api.py and sessions_api.py. Suggest and implement MongoDB indexes to improve performance. Add explain() output to verify improvements.
```

"Match the type definitions in frontend/src/types/"
```

**DON'T:**
```
"Add [new framework] to the project"
"Rewrite [existing feature] using [different approach]"
"Change the architecture to [completely different pattern]"
```

### 2. Security First

**Always ask:**
```
"Review this code for security vulnerabilities, especially:
- SQL injection in database queries
- XSS in user inputs
- JWT token handling
- Password storage
- File upload validation"
```

### 3. Test Everything

**For every feature:**
```
"Create comprehensive tests for [feature] including:
- Happy path scenarios
- Error cases
- Edge cases
- Security tests
- Performance tests"
```

### 4. Type Safety

**TypeScript & Python:**
```
"Add proper type hints to all functions"
"Fix all TypeScript 'any' types"
"Use strict type checking"
"Add runtime validation with Pydantic/Zod"
```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Breaking Existing Functionality
**Problem:** Changing code without understanding dependencies
**Solution:** Always run full test suite before committing
```bash
make test  # Run this EVERY time before commit
```

### 2. Ignoring Security
**Problem:** Not validating inputs, using string concatenation in SQL
**Solution:** Use parameterized queries, validate all inputs
```python
# BAD
query = f"SELECT * FROM items WHERE barcode = '{barcode}'"

# GOOD
query = "SELECT * FROM items WHERE barcode = ?"
cursor.execute(query, (barcode,))
```

### 3. Not Following Patterns
**Problem:** Introducing new patterns inconsistent with codebase
**Solution:** Always ask AI to follow existing patterns
```
"Implement this following the same pattern as [existing file]"
```

### 4. Committing Without Testing
**Problem:** Broken code in main branch
**Solution:** Pre-commit hooks + manual verification
```bash
# Pre-commit hooks will run automatically
git commit -m "..."

# But also manually run:
make ci
```
