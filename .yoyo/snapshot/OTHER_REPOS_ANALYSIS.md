- **Effort:** Medium (4-6 hours)
- **Value:** High - Better performance

### 💡 CONSIDER LATER

#### 4. **React Native Bottom Sheet** 💡 CONSIDER
- **Repo:** https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet
- **Why:** Better bottom sheet implementation
- **Current:** You have `ui/BottomSheet.tsx`
- **Recommendation:** Evaluate if current implementation needs improvement
- **Effort:** Medium (3-5 hours)

#### 5. **React Native Flash List** 💡 CONSIDER
- **Repo:** https://github.com/shopify/flash-list
- **Why:** Better performance than FlatList
- **Use for:** Large data tables (DataTable component)
- **Effort:** Low (1-2 hours)
- **Value:** Medium - Performance boost for large lists

#### 6. **React Native Paper** 💡 CONSIDER
- **Repo:** https://github.com/callstack/react-native-paper
- **Why:** Material Design components
- **Recommendation:** Only if migrating from custom components
- **Effort:** High (8-12 hours)
- **Value:** Medium - Only if maintenance burden increases

### ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED (For This Project)

#### 7. **React Native Elements** ❌ SKIP
- **Why:** Your custom components are working well
- **Recommendation:** Keep custom components
- **Migration cost:** High (10+ hours)
- **Value:** Low - No significant benefit

#### 8. **NativeBase** ❌ SKIP
- **Why:** Large bundle size, less flexible
- **Recommendation:** Stick with custom components

#### 9. **UI Kitten** ❌ SKIP
- **Why:** Overkill for your use case
- **Recommendation:** Current components sufficient

## 🎯 ACTION PLAN

### Immediate (High Value, Low Effort)

1. **React Native Gesture Handler** ⭐
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install react-native-gesture-handler
   ```
   - Enhance SwipeableRow
   - Improve touch interactions

2. **React Native Reusables** ⭐
   ```bash
   npm install @rnr/ui
   ```
   - Better form components
   - Accessibility improvements

### Short Term (High Value, Medium Effort)

3. **React Native Reanimated** ⭐
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-reanimated
   ```
   - Smooth animations
   - Better UX

### Evaluate Later

4. **React Native Flash List** 💡
   - Only if DataTable performance issues arise
   - Test with large datasets first

5. **React Native Bottom Sheet** 💡
   - Compare with current implementation
   - Migrate only if needed

## 🔍 CURRENT COMPONENT STATUS

### ✅ Well Implemented (Keep Custom)
- Button ✅
- Input ✅
- Card ✅
- Modal ✅
- DataTable ✅
- SearchAutocomplete ✅

### 🔧 Could Benefit from Libraries
- SwipeableRow → Gesture Handler
- Animations → Reanimated
- Forms → Reusables (accessibility)

## 💰 COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

### High ROI (Do First)
1. **Gesture Handler** - Better UX, small effort
2. **Reusables** - Accessibility, small effort
3. **Reanimated** - Performance, medium effort

### Medium ROI (Consider)
4. **Flash List** - Performance boost if needed
5. **Bottom Sheet** - Only if current has issues

### Low ROI (Skip)
6. **react-native-elements** - Migration cost too high
7. **NativeBase** - Bundle size concern
8. **UI Kitten** - Overkill

---

**Recommendation:** Start with Gesture Handler and Reusables for immediate improvements, then add Reanimated for animations.
