# Plan Quality Checklist: Comprehensive App Improvements

**Purpose**: Validate implementation plan quality and completeness
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [specs/002-system-modernization-and-enhancements/plan.md](../plan.md)

## Plan Structure

- [x] Follows standard template
- [x] Links to correct specification
- [x] Defines clear phases and dependencies
- [x] Identifies all necessary file changes

## Constitution Compliance

- [x] **Stability First**: Identifies backward compatibility risks and mitigations
- [x] **Verification Mandatory**: Includes specific testing tasks for every feature
- [x] **SQL Read-Only**: Respects read-only constraints for ERP data
- [x] **No AI Guessing**: References existing patterns and docs
- [x] **Unified Documentation**: Includes tasks to update `codebase_memory_v2.1.md`

## Technical Feasibility

- [x] Technology stack aligns with project standards (FastAPI, React Native)
- [x] Architecture decisions are sound and documented
- [x] Performance goals are realistic and measurable
- [x] Security implications are addressed

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require plan updates before proceeding to implementation.
- **Verification**: Added specific testing tasks (IDs 21-27, 30) to ensure compliance with "Verification Mandatory".
- **Documentation**: Added task ID 28 to explicitly update `codebase_memory_v2.1.md`.
